        Welcome to the MDN learning area. This set of articles aims to guide complete <br/> beginners to web development with all that they need to start coding websites.

      <p>
      The aim of this area of MDN is not to take you from "beginner" to "expert" but to <br/>take you from "beginner" to "comfortable." From there, you should be able to start <br/>making your way, learning from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">the rest of MDN</a>, and other intermediate to <br/>advanced resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
      If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging â€” we will hold <br/>your hand and provide enough detail for you to feel comfortable and learn the topics <br/>properly. You should feel at home whether you are a student learning web <br/>development (on your own or as part of a class), a teacher looking for class <br/>materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand more about how <br/>web technologies work.
